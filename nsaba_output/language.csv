This protein is a type B gastrin receptor, which has a high affinity for both sulfated and nonsulfated CCK analogs and is found principally in the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. A misspliced transcript variant including an intron has been observed in cells from colorectal and pancreatic tumors. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
9079.0,LIM domain binding 2,-0.39724036541922431,1.7857719684680637e-05,"The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the LIM-domain binding family. Members of this family are characterized by a conserved nuclear localization sequence, an amino-terminal homodimerization domain and a carboxy-terminal LIM interaction domain. These proteins function as adapter molecules to allow assembly of transcriptional regulatory complexes. Genetic association studies suggest functions for this gene in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and coronary artery disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded product is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. This protein may play an important role in tumorogenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. A pseudogene, which is located on chromosome 17, has been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
