The protein is a component of the nuclear matrix during the G2 phase of interphase. In late G2 the protein associates with the kinetochore and maintains this association through early anaphase. It localizes to the spindle midzone and the intracellular bridge in late anaphase and telophase, respectively, and is thought to be subsequently degraded. The localization of this protein suggests that it may play a role in chromosome segregation during mitotis. It is thought to form either a homodimer or heterodimer. Autoantibodies against this protein have been found in patients with cancer or graft versus host disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

This cyclin was found to bind to important cell cycle regulators, such as Rb family proteins, transcription factor E2F-1, and the p21 family proteins.

The enzyme encoded by this gene is a member of the heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzyme family. It is a type II integral membrane protein and possesses heparan sulfate glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase activity. This gene is expressed predominantly in brain and may play a role in the nervous system. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
5475.0,"protein phosphatase, EF-hand calcium binding domain 1",-0.2633825093919247,0.0043444650419218944,"This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase with EF-hand motif family. The protein contains a protein phosphatase catalytic domain, and at least two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs in its C terminus. Although its substrate(s) is unknown, the encoded protein has been suggested to play a role in specific sensory neuron function and/or development. This gene shares high sequence similarity with the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants, each encoding a distinct isoform, have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

This gene encodes a nitric oxide synthase which is expressed in liver and is inducible by a combination of lipopolysaccharide and certain cytokines. Three related pseudogenes are located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

The encoded protein plays a role in the regulation of fluid balance in the intestine. A similar protein in mouse is thought to regulate differentiation and proliferation of cells in the colon. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]"
84695.0,lysyl oxidase-like 3,-0.26017119874202427,0.0048448374247153526,"This gene encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase gene family. The prototypic member of the family is essential to the biogenesis of connective tissue, encoding an extracellular copper-dependent amine oxidase that catalyses the first step in the formation of crosslinks in collagens and elastin. A highly conserved amino acid sequence at the C-terminus end appears to be sufficient for amine oxidase activity, suggesting that each family member may retain this function. The N-terminus is poorly conserved and may impart additional roles in developmental regulation, senescence, tumor suppression, cell growth control, and chemotaxis to each member of the family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been reported but their full-length nature has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
