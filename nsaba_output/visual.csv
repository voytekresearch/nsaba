The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor that mediates the sodium-independent uptake of thyroid hormones in brain tissues. This protein has particularly high affinity for the thyroid hormones thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine and reverse tri-iodothyronine. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding this protein may be associated with fatigue and depression in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

This protein, like other family members, is thought to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Epigenetic inactivation of this gene is associated with breast and other cancers, suggesting that it may function as a tumor suppressor. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]"

The enzyme encoded is responsible for catalyzing the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid from L-glutamic acid. A pathogenic role for this enzyme has been identified in the human pancreas since it has been identified as an autoantigen and an autoreactive T cell target in insulin-dependent diabetes. This gene may also play a role in the stiff man syndrome. Deficiency in this enzyme has been shown to lead to pyridoxine dependency with seizures. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two products, the predominant 67-kD form and a less-frequent 25-kD form. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
